529s made easier

My name is Chris Werner and I represent OppenheimerFunds as a 529 Consultant.

My goal is to make recommending 529s a smart, easy decision for you. With tax time approaching, some of your clients may be 
asking about college savings plans that offer tax benefits. With Bright Start 529, your Illinois clients can realize tax 
advantages with deductions from state taxable income up to $10,000 ($20,000 if married and filed jointly) per year*. 

Of course, there are more benefits to recommending Bright Start than just tax savings:

-Advisor sold plans increased over 14% in the last year

-Dedicated financial advisor line for any question you have

-Flexible investment options to fit your clients' savings goals 

-Fully-integrated brand campaign driving awareness year round
